-   Suggested topics to cover:
    -   Names and backgrounds of TEALS team members
    -   Brief background on TEALS program (i.e. "Why are there so many adults here?")
    -   Classroom rules, behavior expectations, grading guidelines, late work policies, etc.
    -   Academic Integrity/Cheating policy
    -   Introductions/Icebreakers with students
    -   High-level learning objectives for course

## Accommodation/Differentiation

-   In some school's the first day of schools is an altered or shortened schedule.  Find this out ahead of time and plan for however much time you have available.
    -   If necessary, split these topics across multiple days.
