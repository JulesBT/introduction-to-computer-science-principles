# Lesson 2.5: Combining Variables  <!-- Formerly 2.6 -->

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

-   Combine loops with conditionals to create models with repeated but conditional behavior

## Instructor's Notes


    
1.  Review and lecture
    1.  Review loops and conditionals
        -   Ask students what loops do, when they are useful, and what loops exist in SNAP
            -   loops cause code to execute multiple times
            -   loops can help reduce redundancy and increase readability
            -   SNAP contains three loops: repeat, forever, and repeat until
        -   Ask students what conditionals are for and when they are useful
            -   conditionals are used to execute a block of code only under certain circumstances
        -   Encourage discussion about previous activities
        -   Fill in understanding gaps when necessary
    2.  Demonstrate combining loops and conditionals
        -   Present ![](<repeat until.png>) and ![](foreverIf.png)
        -   Ask students to suggest when these constructs might be useful
            -   "repeat until" is useful when a loop needs to run not for a set number of iterations, but until some situation occurs
            -   "forever if" is useful when code should execute _any time_ a condition is true, for the duration of the program
        -   Point out that the condition in "repeat until" is a termination condition, while in "forever-if" it is a continuation condition
    3.  Introduce the concept of modeling
        -   _modeling: building a system to simulate the behavior of a real-life phenomenon by simplifying or ignoring certain details_
        -   Ask students to suggest systems or concepts that might need to be modeled
        -   Discuss important considerations when designing and implementing a model
            -   Lead students to realize that most sacrifice some amount of accuracy or realism for simplicity
2.  Activity
    -   Students should complete "What Goes Up..." lab individually
        -   Mention that the code written in this lab will be helpful for the Platform Game project
3.  Debrief

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   Take care to ensure that all students have functional code by the end of the lab to avoid putting some students at a disadvantage starting the project
    -   If many students struggle, consider releasing your own solution after the lab has been completed in class
    -   Utilize TAs and advanced students to assist struggling studentsâ€”it is vital that all students complete this lab in advance of starting the project
-   Advanced students can consider increasing the realism of their gravity model by adding acceleration and/or beginning to implement jumping
