## Instructor's Notes

*  BJC Video Suggestion: [BJC Lecture 8: Concurrency Algorithm (Yaniv Assaf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlLLcGJPvwU)) 
*   This lecture focuses on high level algorithmic concepts which may be of use for higher level students.  It also explains the physical parts of a computer and how it works, which may be helpful for students who are unfamiliar with computers.
